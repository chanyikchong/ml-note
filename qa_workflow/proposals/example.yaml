# This is an example of how to submit a documentation update proposal

title: "Add clarification on Ridge vs Lasso coefficient shrinkage"

description: |
  The current documentation explains Ridge and Lasso well, but could benefit
  from a clearer visual comparison of how coefficients shrink differently
  under each regularization scheme.

  This enhancement adds a visual diagram showing:
  - Ridge: All coefficients shrink proportionally
  - Lasso: Some coefficients hit zero, others shrink

      | L1 (Lasso) | L2 (Ridge) |
      |------------|------------|
      | Yes (exact zeros) | No |
    after: |
      | Property | L1 (Lasso) | L2 (Ridge) |
      |----------|------------|------------|
      | Sparsity | Yes (exact zeros) | No |
      | Visual | Coefficients hit zero | All shrink toward zero |
